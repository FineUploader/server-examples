# Server-Side Examples for the Widen Fine Uploader Javascript Library #

This repository contains server-side examples for users of Widen's Fine Uploader javascript library.  Server side examples
for Fine Uploader S3 will appear in a S3 directory under the language of choice.  All other examples assume you are
uploading files to your own server.

For guidelines useful when integrating your server-side code with Fine Uploader, see the [server-side notes 
and guidelines readme](https://github.com/Widen/fine-uploader/blob/master/docs/server.md) in the Fine Uploader repository.
